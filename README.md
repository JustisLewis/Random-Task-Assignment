Random task assignment program 
<br>
This program randomly assigns team members to 3 different tasks following these steps: 

1. Read in a team roster, which inlcudes information on team members who have recently completed these tasks. 
2. Create a "population" dataframe by removing team members who have recently done these tasks. 
3. Select two people for the first task. Remove them from the population and then select two people for the second task - etc.
